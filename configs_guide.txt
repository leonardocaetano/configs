============ WINDOWS

- some software you need to install:
 
- powertoys (disable ctrl focus), sysinternals suite, voidtools everything, free downaload manager, firefox (also login to your account to sync everything), speedscrunch calculator, wolfram mathematica, startallback
(look for your start startallback key), 7zip, milton software, qbittorent, vlc, sumatrapdf, notepad++, baregrep, less (also put it on yout $PATH)
 
- download and sync google drive (remeber to set it to c:\drive)

- some dev specific software:
 
- emacs, llvm (put it on c:\LLVM, also in your path), visual studio

- for emacs you want to create a user variable called HOME with the value c:\home 

- download msys2, use the MSYS2 MSYS launcher (this enables the use of linux tools like awk, gdb, etc inside windows, for native windows dev)

- remember to bind ctrl to capslock using ctrl2cap.exe
 
- disable the hibernation file with powercfg.exe /hibernate off

- disable computer poweroff in control panel

- disable that weird ctrl+shit sticky keys and locale change in... somewhere in the system menu
 
- disable system sounds in control panel -> sound -> sounds
 
- on windows 11, restore the old right click running windows\restore_old_menu_w11.reg

- if you are dual booting with linux run windows\windows_utc_for_linux_dualboot.reg

- run windows.bat to sync your config files

============ ARCH LINUX

- install it using arch-install included script

- just use the default pacman mirror, it is the fastest one

- use gnome, install gnome-extra and gnome-tweaks (to bind ctrl to caps)

- TO FIX EMACS IN GNOME: commenting out the StartupWMClass line in /usr/share/applications/emacsclient.desktop allows pinning the Emacs (GUI) desktop entry and doesn't add another icon

- generally, you want to run pacman -Syyu once every two weeks

- some things you mostly will want to install: emacs vim ttf-liberation ripgrep llvm clang gcc gdb less

- remember to give your user full access to sudo, wheel, etc. also to remove the need to put sudo password everytime

- run linux.sh to sync your config files

============ EMACS

- copy .emacs to your home folder
- install ripgrep and liberation mono

- some basic emacs usage:

F5: cicle trough .c/.h
F6: ripgrep
F8: compile
F12: filetree
remember to use chmod u+x to be able to compile
M-x dired to create folders (+) and files (C-x C-f)
To delete files in dired, select them with x and use d to delete them

============ GIT

- install git and github-cli

- git commands:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@example.com"

- to test this:

git config --get user.name
git config --get user.email

- to change the default branch on new repositories from master to main:

git config --global init.defaultBranch main

- to enable colorful output:

git config --global color.ui auto

- now, for github-cli:

gh auth login

- that's it. this started a interative login process

- basic usage:

git add *
git commit -m "Your comment"
git push

git pull

git clone <repo>
